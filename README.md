## Nuxeo

The Nuxeo Platform is an open source customizable and extensible content management platform for building business applications. It provides the foundation for developing document management, digital asset management, case management application and knowledge management. You can easily add features using ready-to-use addons or by extending the platform using its extension point system.

The Nuxeo Platform is developed and supported by Nuxeo, with contributions from the community.

## Building EloraPLM

To create EloraPLM package we have to build it as any other Nuxeo package, using the latest hotfix of Nuxeo Platform LTS 2015. In case you are not a Nuxeo subscriber, you will have to build the latest hotfix from source, following the process described here: https://doc.nuxeo.com/corg/compiling-nuxeo-from-sources/
